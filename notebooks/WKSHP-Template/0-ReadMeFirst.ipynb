    "## Lab flow\n",
    "{{ BRANDINGWOD }} Workshops-on-Demand are delivered through a central point that allows a portable, dynamic version of the lab guides. Rather than using standard PDF files that always end in copy / paste errors from the lab guide into TS sessions, we leverage an infrastructure that uses a JupyterHub server on which all the different lab guides are stored in a notebook format (*.ipynb).\n",

    "## A quick look at Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook is an open source solution for interactive documents that are commonly used to hold code for ML/DL models. But it can also be used in many other ways.\n",
    "A notebook consists of cells. A cell can be either a markdown cell (contains comments, text, images) or a code cell. \n",

    "• A notebook is a series of cells\n",
    "\n",
    "• The notebook uses a kernel (visible in the upper right corner of the notebook)\n",
    "\n",
    "• A cell can be either markdown or code (in the selected kernel)\n",

    "\n",
    "    o The Play button at the top\n",
    "    o Ctrl-Enter (run and stay on same cell)\n",
    "    o Shift-Enter (run and move to next cell)\n",
    "    \n",

    "> **Note:**  When you see an [*] next to the action, it means your execution step is busy working within the notebook. When you see a digit number, it means the execution of the step is completed.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "• Running a markdown cell just renders it\n",
    "\n",
    "• Running a code cell runs the code and displays the output just below the cell\n",
    "\n",
    "• When a cell is running, it displays an [*] to its left. Then, when finished, it displays a counter of the number of executions of that cell\n",
    "\n",
